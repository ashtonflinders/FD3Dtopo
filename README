1 Introduction

  This program simulates seismic wave propagation in 3D complex media with
  surface topography by using non-staggered finite difference method.
  We use body-fitted grid to conform the grid surface with free surface
  topography, then the non-staggered FD scheme, DRP/opt MacCormack scheme
  (Hixon,1997), is used to update the stress-velocity wave equations.
  The traction free surface boundary condition is implemented through
  Traction Image method (Zhang and Chen, 2006).

3 Usage
  
  1) cd code/, type 
       ./run.make.sh
     to compile the programs
     # setting FC, LIB_NETCDF, MOD_NETCDF according to your system first
     # in Makefile and Makefile.opt.WHEREAMI
     after compiling, all executable programs will be in a created
     bin/ directory here.
  2) cd run/valid.hill3d.Gauss/
     modify the input *.conf file
     and prepare input files,
     then execute
         ./bin/seis3d_grid or qsub pbs_grid_mpi.sh
         ./bin/seis3d_media or qsub pbs_media_mpi.sh
         ./bin/seis3d_metric or qsub pbs_metric_mpi.sh
         ./bin/seis3d_source
         ./bin/seis3d_station
         qsub pbs_wave_mpi.sh
         # the above steps valid for OpenPBS/torque job control system,
         # you should create submitting scripts according the actual job
         # control systme used. Or use mpirun directly
         # nohup mpirun -np NNN -nolocal -machinefile hostlist bin/seis3d_wave_mpi &
