1 Introduction

  This program simulates seismic wave propagation in 3D complex media with
  surface topography by using non-staggered finite difference method.
  We use body-fitted grid to conform the grid surface with free surface
  topography, then the non-staggered FD scheme, DRP/opt MacCormack scheme
  (Hixon,1997), is used to update the stress-velocity wave equations.
  The traction free surface boundary condition is implemented through
  Traction Image method (Zhang and Chen, 2006).

3 Usage
  
  1) For Bluewaves only; open up an interactive connection to a node so we are not 
  performing the following actions on the head node,
  
    interact -X -w 20:00:00
  
  2) cd into the cloned FD3Dtopo directory
  
  3) Compile the code by changing into the code.vlow/ directory, and run;
  
    ./run.make.sh
  
  4) Prepare example starting model by changing into example/grand_canyon/model_setup,
  and run;
  
    ./make_model.sh
  
  5) Exit the interactive node connection;
  
    exit
  
  6) Run the example simulation by changing into example/grand_canyon/simulation and 
  running each of the following successively, waiting for the previous to finish before
  starting the next;
  
    qsub pbs_grid_mpi.sh
    qsub pbs_metric_mpi.sh
    qsub pbs_media_mpi.sh
    qsub pbs_source_mpi.sh
    qsub pbs_station_mpi.sh
    qsub pbs_wave_mpi.sh
